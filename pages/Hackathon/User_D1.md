#### Benchmarking  {#benchmarking}

Often one has two (or multiple) data of different frequency for the same
target variable. Sometimes, however, these data are not coherent in the
sense that they don’t match up. Benchmarking[^1] is a method to overcome
this situation. It happens quite often, as aggregate of higher-frequency
measurement is not necessarily equal to the less-aggregated measurement.
Moreover, the sources of data may have different reliability. Usually it
is thought that less frequent data are more trustworthy as they are
based on larger samples and compiled more precisely. In general, the
more reliable measurements are considered as benchmarks.
